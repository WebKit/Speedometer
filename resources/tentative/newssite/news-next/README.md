# The Daily Broadcast

This app is a news-site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It utilizes the [News Site Template](https://github.com/flashdesignory/news-site-template) as the basis for styling and functionality. 

Due to technical constraints, this project's build step uses [static html export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

## Local Development

Start the local dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

To create new build files, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Test steps

The Speedometer test consists of navigating between the different pages of the news site. 
It includes interactions with the navigation drop-down menu to ensure state changes happen in between the page navigations.
