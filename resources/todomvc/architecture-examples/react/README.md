# Speedometer 3.0: TodoMVC: React

## Description

This application uses React in combination with Redux to implement a todo application.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.\

## Implementation details

The storage solution uses an in-memory data object that implements a simple array to hold the todos.

## Built steps

To build the static files, this application utilizes webpack. It minifies and optimizes output files and copies all necessary files to a `dist` folder.

## Requirements

The only requirement is an installation of Node, to be able to install dependencies and run scripts to serve a local server.

```
* Node (min version: 18.13.0)
* NPM (min version: 8.19.3)
```
